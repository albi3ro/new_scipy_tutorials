# new_scipy_tutorials

As I work to create new tutorials for [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html), I keep the work in progress here before moving it over to the official site on completion.  

I encourage feedback, issues, and pull requests.

Some goals: 
* Have all tutorials availible in notebook format as well as static format
* Provide simplest examples
* Explain edge cases
* Easy Navigation
* Compare and contrast backends and expalin behind the scene workings

Currently, I'm working on scipy.optimize.
